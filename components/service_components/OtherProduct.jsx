            Coffee is such an important dietary staple across the world that it
            has spawned a staggeringly large economy of its own. Coffee
            roasters, packers, growers, marketers and coffee equipment
            manufacturers depend on the commodity as do dairy producers and
            restaurant operators.

            Soybeans are an edible legume native to Asia and are an important
            source of protein in many modern diets. Chinese farmers first
            domesticated soybeans around 1100 BC. Since that time, cultures
            around the world have cultivated the crop as a food source.
